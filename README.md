# CEN3024-Multiple-Threads
In a nutshell, this is a Java program that compares the performance between multi-threading &amp; single thread performance.

To compare the performance between these multi-threading and single thread: 200 million random integers ranging from 1 to 10 are generated.
Each method (multi-threaded / single threaded)'s efficency is measured based on how fast it's able to sum up said randomly generated integers.
